In 2013 I graduated with my degree in Mathematics from Portland State University. Before that, I had had flirtations with web development spread over many years. Since graduating, I have become enamored with all-things web development, and am currently honing my skills in JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3 and associated frameworks. I also enjoy creating things in Python, and have lots of experience grinding out code in PHP. I love finding clear, elegant solutions to complex problems, and my objective is to move into a position where I have the chance to practice this ability. If you'd like, you can check out my current [projects](/pages/projects.html). Feel free to send me an e-mail or message about them!

I am a passionate learner; I am constantly diving into new subjects and looking to immerse myself in communities that foster technical and personal development. Mastery is my goal, and my eagerness to jump in with both feet and absorb anything and everything has helped me greatly on my journey towards it.

In my free time, I train, compete and teach sport Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I am the beginner's "No-Gi" (BJJ without the traditional uniform, practiced in shorts and rashguard) coach at Five Rings Jiu Jitsu in Beaverton, OR and have been training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 3 years now. The combination of mental strategery and physicality both frustrates me and spurs me on.
