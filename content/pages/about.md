I am a passionate learner, constantly diving into new subjects and looking to immerse myself in communities that foster technical and personal development. Mastery is my goal, and my eagerness to jump in with both feet and absorb anything and everything has helped me greatly on my journey towards it.

I have become enamored with all-things web development, and am honing my skills in JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3 and associated frameworks. I also enjoy creating things in Python, and have lots of experience grinding out code in PHP. I love finding clear, elegant solutions to complex problems, and my objective is to move into a position where I have the chance to practice this ability.

I am the beginner's "No-Gi" (BJJ without the traditional uniform, practiced in shorts and rashguard) coach at Five Rings Jiu Jitsu in Beaverton, OR and have been training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 3 years now. I currently am a blue belt. I compete constantly, and have won Gold in no-gi and Silver in gi. The combination of mental strategery and physicality both frustrates me and spurs me on.
